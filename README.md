# openDSR API

## Overview
openDSR is an open-source standard that defines a unified framework for Demand Side Response (DSR) in energy management systems. Demand Side Response is a strategy that allows electricity consumers to adjust their power consumption patterns based on real-time grid conditions, contributing to grid stability, reducing costs, and enhancing energy efficiency.

This repository contains the official documentation and specifications for the openDSR standard. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide for developers, energy providers, and stakeholders interested in implementing DSR solutions using the openDSR standard.
